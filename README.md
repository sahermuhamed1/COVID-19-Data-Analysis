**COVIDE-19 Data Analysis using Power BI**

This project is using power Bi to analyzing COVIDE-19 Dataset provided by 'Ministry of World Health' and the link of the dattaset is here 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadrezagim/who-covid-19-global-data' which contains a lot of data such as the number of vaccines, the number of new and old vaccinations, the number of cases, and other data that I used to extract insights that benefits the stakeholders and makes them see the data in a more detailed way with accuracy


First I went to EXCEL and I did some data cleaning using it, Then I uploaded my EXCEL data source, then go to the transformation data page in Power Query and cleaned my data using it in some steps, then I went to my Data Model View to set up the relationship between tables, then I Extract the important info from the dataset after the cleaning and modeling process to give the stakeholder a solid insights of their dataset.✅

This Dashboard Provides a lot of insights such as Tracking the number of Deaths and Cases of COVIDE-19, Track the Survivors, Track The number of Doses for each person who takes the Vaccinations, and finally what is the relationship between the Doses and Deaths.👨‍💻📈

Always remember that the great dashboard starts with a great business question and my business question here is "What is the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations on the number of cases, deaths, and survivors, and how does the dosage administration relate to the mortality rate?"🤔👌
